A Snapshot of Me:

- 🌍 Passionate about environmental modeling, especially the dramatic water events like floods and droughts since the age of dinosaurs.
- 🏜️ Began my Earth Science adventure at four in the Taklamakan Desert, where I mastered cooking an egg using only the sun-warmed sand.
- 🧪 I earned the title of "Dishwashing Master" during post-kindergarten days spent in the stairwell by my mom's lab, perfecting the art of glassware cleaning.
- 🎹 Years of piano lessons ignited a deep love for music. Despite testing my mom's patience, these experiences fueled my aspiration to form a Punk/Funk/Disco band. Sorry, Mom, classical music just wasn't my calling!
- 🚵 Transitioning from swimming and running to cycling post ankle injury, I've logged over 11,980 km on my bike since May 2022, and I'm not stopping yet. I aim to compete in a gravel bike race before turning fifty.
